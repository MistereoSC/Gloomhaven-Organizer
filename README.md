# Gloomhaven-Organizer
3D files for my Gloomhaven Organizer (Mostly Base-Game Only)
I used Fusion360 to create the files, so I do not know how good the export to other file formats is!

The Insert fits inside the base box and accommodates everything from the base game, and most of the Forgotten Circles Expansion, except the Monster Tokens.
The Floor Tiles have to be stored separately, but I highly recommend an Accordion Binder to sort and store them separately!

The Insert is meant to be built with 5mm Foamcore (I think it took about 3 and a half A4 sheets).

A second Insert for the Jaws of the Lion and Forgotten Circles Expansions is in the works!
